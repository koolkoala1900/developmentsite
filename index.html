  <h1>Development Project: Clothing App</h1>
  <h5>PROJECT PROMPT</h5>
  <p>In this project, we developed an interactive interface, used interface components, and tied the components to an internal data state. This project allowed me to get comfortable with React by creating a list-based interface for users to select items out of a list, which then aggregates them.
</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      
  <h5>FEATURES WE INCLUDED</h5>
  <p>
    At least 2 filtering categories

    At least 1 sorting feature

    Items you added to the aggregator
</p>
<p>
    Aggregation of a property: total time, cost, votes, etc., but NOT the total number of items

    Item image

    <h5 ><span >TAKEAWAYS</span></h5>
    <p>
        I learned a lot about React hooks, interactive states, and essentially what it means to make a fully functional application. This project provides a great baseline for many other potential applications that I could create. I'm really excited to play more with user interface and design choices in future applications and feel more comfortable with React.
